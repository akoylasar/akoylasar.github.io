      <description>Introduction In this article I am going to derive some of the most commonly used transformations in nealy all graphics applications.
My goal is to explain this as simply as I can without mathematical loss. Of course the proofs won&#39;t follow the standard mathematical rigour which I think in our case should be perfectly OK. Also in order to keep the article short I would make this assumption that the readers are more or less familiar with matrices and linear transformations.</description>
