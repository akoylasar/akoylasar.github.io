      <description>In his book 3 in the fantastic series Raytracing in a weekend Peter Shirley computes an integral numerically and leaves the analytical solution as an exercise.
This analytical proof is presented below.
Putting everything down formally, this is what we&amp;rsquo;re tryign to compute:
$$ \iint_{\Omega} f dS $$ The integrand is a function in spherical coordinates, that is \(f(r, \theta, \phi) = \cos^2(\theta) \). Domain of integration is denoted by \(\Omega\)</description>

      <title>A trip down the transformation pipeline in Mapbox GL-JS</title>

      <description>In this article I will briefly explain how GL-JS renders an encoded point from a vector tile onto the screen.
Few notes I assume you already know what vector tiles are so here are few things to know about Mapbox vector tiles:
They are agnostic of geographics information. Mapbox vector tiles have a resolution of 512 pixels. They are efficiently encoded (using google protobufs) for fast transfer over web.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go!</description>
